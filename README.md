Credit for the base code (some modifications were made) goes to [express-kittens](https://github.com/thoughtworks-jumpstart/express-kittens) - thank you!

This repo is created for the purpose of a live demo, to demonstrate **Broken Access Control** as part of an [OWASP Top 10](https://engineering.developerguide.xyz/#/security/owasp-top-10?id=_5-broken-access-control) class.
